## Created a Princeton Courses Searcher using React as frontend and FastAPI to create the search algorithm. 

For the model, I utilized sentence similarity models from huggingface to develop the semantic similarity between the search and the course content. I used this to create a vector and the search queries for the knn closest neighbor of the vector and the input query.
